# IUMS_MSc_Human_Genetics

A repository to upload datasets and publicly available scripts used for publications at the medical genetics department at IUMS.

## Projects

### 1. Genetic Diagnosis in Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD)
I led and worked on a genetic diagnosis project where we searched for pathogenic variants in patients with maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), which is a metabolic disorder. The relevant files for this project can be found in the [MSUD](MSUD/) directory.

### 2. Gene Expression Analysis in Preeclampsia
I also led and worked on a gene expression analysis project in preeclampsia, a multifactorial complex disorder affecting pregnant women. We performed a meta-analysis of gene expression datasets to detect differentially regulated genes in the placenta. The relevant files for this project can be found in the [Preeclampsia](Preeclampsia/) directory.
