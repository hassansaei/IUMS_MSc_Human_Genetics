# IUMS_MSc_Human_Genetics

A repository to upload datasets and publicly available scripts used for publications at the medical genetics department at IUMS.

## Projects

### 1. Genetic Diagnosis in Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD)
I led and worked on a genetic diagnosis project where we searched for pathogenic variants in patients with maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), which is a metabolic disorder. The relevant files for this project can be found in the [MSUD](MSUD/) directory.

#### Main Figures from the published paper

*Figure 1: Overview of the step-wise workflow for the expression array data meta-analysis. Selection process of eligible microarray datasets for meta-analysis of PE and Control. Depiction of the flow chart of the process involved in dataset integration and merge data analysis pipeline.*

*Figure 2: The volcano plot illustrates the up-regulated and down-regulated DEGs of the placenta across PEs and the healthy controls. The x-axis represents the log 2-fold change (FC), and the y-axis represents -log10 adjusted p-value.*

### 2. Gene Expression Analysis in Preeclampsia
I also led and worked on a gene expression analysis project in preeclampsia, a multifactorial complex disorder affecting pregnant women. We performed a meta-analysis of gene expression datasets to detect differentially regulated genes in the placenta. The relevant files for this project can be found in the [Preeclampsia](Preeclampsia/) directory.
